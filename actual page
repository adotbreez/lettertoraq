        const letterContent = `dear raquel,
thank you. i believe that's the first thing that you deserve to hear from me, you've been nothing short of a blessing to my life.
from day one, i think that there was always this weird force drawing me toward you, despite my efforts to try and pull away. 
i've told you before, but i didn't want to become another story told. regardless, i had begun to fall in love with you, and for
reasons that i couldn't begin to list. but i will try.
the purity of your heart is, with no doubt, one of the most attractive things about you. it's one thing to be a sweetheart to me,
but seeing you just generally being kind to all those around you/us makes me head-over-heels. i can be weak in front of you and to
you without a worry that i'm at risk of being taken advantage of. i really really appreciate that, i'm a very emotional person and
it's difficult to hold it in, you've always made me more than comfortable enough to express it. 
secondly, your intelligence, and your general passion/goals. i can't tell you about the butterflies that suffocated my heart when
i read the sonnet you wrote for me. even generally when i read anything that you write (or especially if i hear you read it)
there's this profound sense of admiration that just makes me melt in the thought of having the privilege of loving you. you genuinely
inspire me, though, i mean i sort of copied your career goal of becoming a professor, and i think i always try to be my best self
thanks to you just being yourself. you being amazing makes me want to be amazing.
i think that you're very beautiful. honestly, though, i don't think that words can accurately describe the visual masterpiece that
you exist as. maybe i shall compare thee to a summer's day. you remind me of when dante alighieri described a woman whomst he met
(Beatrice) as a new chapter in his life. in the book which is my memory, on the first page, the chapter that i met you, appear the 
words "here come a new life." i think all of the imperfection in the world exists solely due to the universe utilizing all of 
its resources striving to create you as the embodiment of perfection. i want you, and i'm greedy. i want all of you until i'm 
full of you. every inch of you. i want your lips against mine and to feel the heat of your body against my skin. i want to breathe
you in and never exhale again. i need to be buried in you and let our roots spread for eternity until our love outlives us. 
more or less.
again, i really appreciate you raquel; the things you do and the person that you are. i adore you, genuinely. all of the time 
we've spent, the memories we've made, the places we've gone. it all lives very deeply in my heart. i still have a very very big 
crush on you and i hope our relationship can continue to develop and grow. the greatest gift in the world would be the privilege
to call you mine. here's to our first christmas that we're sharing together, and hopefully we can share many more.

thank you,
